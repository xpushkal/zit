# Product Requirements Document: zit

**Version:** 1.0

**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026

**Status:** MVP Specification

---

## Executive Summary

**zit** is an AI-powered, terminal-based Git and GitHub CLI tool that transforms Git from a command-memorization challenge into an intuitive, visual learning experience. By combining a rich TUI (Terminal User Interface) with intelligent AI mentorship, zit helps developers—especially beginners—learn Git faster, work more safely, and build confidence through guided workflows and real-time explanations.

### Vision

Make Git accessible and understandable for every developer by replacing error-prone commands with safe, visual workflows that teach as they work.

### Mission

Empower developers to master Git through an intelligent terminal interface that prevents mistakes, explains concepts in plain English, and builds intuition about version control.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points

1. **Steep Learning Curve** : Git's complex command syntax and abstract concepts (HEAD, detached HEAD, rebase, cherry-pick) overwhelm beginners
2. **Fear of Mistakes** : Developers avoid powerful Git features due to fear of losing work or breaking history
3. **Cryptic Error Messages** : Git errors are technical and rarely explain what went wrong or how to fix it
4. **Hash-Based Navigation** : Navigating history via SHA hashes is unintuitive and error-prone
5. **Context Switching** : Developers leave the terminal to use GUI tools or search StackOverflow for help
6. **Lack of Guidance** : Git doesn't recommend safe vs. risky operations or explain trade-offs

### Target Users

* **Primary** : Junior developers (0-2 years experience) learning Git fundamentals
* **Secondary** : Intermediate developers (2-5 years) wanting to master advanced features safely
* **Tertiary** : Senior developers seeking productivity gains and reduced cognitive load

---

## Product Overview

### Core Philosophy

**"Terminal-Native Learning Assistant"**

zit is not just a Git UI wrapper—it's a learning tool that:

* Shows the current state visually
* Explains what's happening in plain English
* Guides users toward safe, best-practice workflows
* Provides guardrails without removing power
* Teaches Git concepts through use, not documentation

### Key Differentiators

1. **AI Mentor Integration** : Context-aware AI explains repo state, errors, and recommends actions
2. **Opinionated Safety** : Defaults to non-destructive operations with clear warnings for risky actions
3. **Visual Timeline Navigation** : Browse history by message/time/branch instead of hashes
4. **Terminal-Native** : No context switching; everything happens in the terminal developers already use
5. **Shell-Based Truth** : Uses actual Git commands as source of truth, not reimplementation

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Repository Dashboard

### 9. AI Mentor Layer

 **User Story** : As a developer, I want an AI assistant that understands my repository context and explains Git operations in plain English so I can learn while I work.

 **Requirements** :

#### Context Analysis

* Analyze current repo state (branch, uncommitted changes, conflicts)
* Understand selected commits or ranges
* Parse and explain Git error messages

#### Capabilities

* **Explain Mode** : Describe what's currently happening in the repo
* "You're on branch `feature-login` with 3 uncommitted files"
* "This merge commit brought changes from `main` into your branch"
* **Recommend Mode** : Suggest safest next actions
* "To save your work before switching branches, you should commit or stash"
* "Use a new branch instead of reset to preserve this commit"
* **Warn Mode** : Alert about risky operations
* "Hard reset will permanently delete uncommitted work—are you sure?"
* "This rebase will rewrite public history; consider merge instead"
* **Error Explanation** : Translate Git errors to plain English
* Git error: `fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories`
* AI: "These branches don't share a common ancestor. Use `--allow-unrelated-histories` if you're combining separate projects, or check if you're in the right repository."

#### Technical Implementation

* Serverless backend on AWS Lambda (Python 3.12)
* LLM access via Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3 Sonnet)
* API Gateway with API key auth + usage plan (5,000 req/month, 10 req/sec)
* Context sent: repo state, command intent, relevant diffs, error messages
* Non-blocking: AI calls run on a background thread via `mpsc::channel`
* Automatic retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)

* Privacy: diffs truncated to 3,000 chars, response body capped at 5,000 chars

 **Acceptance Criteria** :

* AI responses appear in <3 seconds (90th percentile)
* Explanations are accurate for 95% of common Git scenarios
* Recommendations clearly indicate safety level (safe/caution/destructive)
* Error explanations include both "what happened" and "how to fix"
* User can disable AI layer via config if desired
* Backend handles rate limiting and retries gracefully

### Data Flow

```
User Input → crossterm → ratatui TUI → Git Commands (shell) → Parse Output → Update UI
                                     ↓
                            GitHub REST API (if applicable)
                                     ↓
                          AI Mentor (if invoked)
                          ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
                          │ spawn std::thread with AiClient      │
                          │ → HTTPS POST to Lambda (with retry)  │
                          │ → result via mpsc::channel           │
                          │ → poll_ai_result() dispatches to UI  │
                          └──────────────────────────────────────┘
                                     ↓
                     AWS Lambda (Python 3.12) → Bedrock Claude → Response
```

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Shell-Based Git Execution** : Use actual Git binary, not reimplementation

* **Rationale** : Git is the source of truth; ensures compatibility and correctness
* **Trade-off** : Slightly slower than library calls, but negligible in practice

1. **TUI Over GUI** : Terminal-native interface

* **Rationale** : Developers already work in terminals; no context switching
* **Trade-off** : Limited visual richness vs. GUI, but faster workflow

1. **Opinionated Defaults** : Non-destructive operations by default

* **Rationale** : Safety first, especially for beginners
* **Trade-off** : Advanced users may find extra confirmations annoying (mitigated via config)

1. **AI as Optional Layer** : Works without AI, enhanced with it

* **Rationale** : Not everyone wants/needs AI; tool should be useful standalone
* **Trade-off** : Two codepaths to maintain

---

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: First-Time Commit

 **Actor** : Junior developer making their first commit

1. Open zit in repository: `zit`
2. Dashboard shows "3 modified files, 0 staged"
3. Navigate to staging view (keyboard shortcut: `s`)
4. Select files to stage using arrow keys + Space
5. Press `c` to open commit interface
6. Type commit message; AI suggests: "Add user authentication endpoints"
7. Confirm commit; dashboard updates to show clean state
8. AI explains: "You've created a snapshot of your changes. Your work is now saved in Git history."

 **Success Metrics** :

* Time to first commit: <2 minutes
* User completes workflow without consulting external documentation
* User understands what they did (measured via optional feedback prompt)

---

### Workflow 2: Recovering from a Mistake

 **Actor** : Developer who accidentally hard reset

1. User realizes they lost a commit after hard reset
2. Opens zit: `zit`
3. Dashboard shows AI warning: "Recent reset detected. Your commit may be in reflog."
4. Press `r` to open reflog viewer
5. Sees deleted commit in list with message and timestamp
6. Selects commit, presses `b` to create recovery branch
7. AI confirms: "Branch `recovery-feb10` created from lost commit. Your work is safe."

 **Success Metrics** :

* Time to recover: <1 minute
* Recovery success rate: 100% if commit is in reflog
* User confidence increase (measured via survey)

---

### Workflow 3: Creating a GitHub Repository

 **Actor** : Developer starting a new project

1. Initialize local repo: `git init` (or `zit init` if we build that)
2. Make initial commits using zit
3. Press `g` to open GitHub integration
4. Select "Create Repository"
5. Enter name: `my-awesome-project`, description, visibility (private)
6. zit creates repo, adds remote, asks to push
7. Confirm push; AI explains: "Your local commits are now on GitHub at github.com/username/my-awesome-project"

 **Success Metrics** :

* Time to GitHub: <3 minutes from first commit
* Zero failed pushes due to misconfiguration
* User successfully shares repo link with collaborator

---

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Git Version Fragmentation

 **Probability** : Medium

 **Impact** : High

 **Description** : Different Git versions may have incompatible output formats, breaking parsing.

 **Mitigation** :

* Require Git 2.30+ (widely available, stable output)
* Use `--porcelain` flags where available for stable output
* Extensive testing across Git versions 2.30, 2.35, 2.40, latest
* Graceful error handling with version detection and user notification

---

### Risk 2: AI Hallucination or Bad Advice

 **Probability** : Medium

 **Impact** : High

 **Description** : LLM gives incorrect Git advice, leading to user mistakes.

 **Mitigation** :

* Context prompts explicitly instruct AI to prioritize safety and admit uncertainty
* AI recommendations labeled with confidence levels (high/medium/low)
* Destructive operations always require manual confirmation regardless of AI advice
* Feedback mechanism to report bad AI advice
* Regular review of AI responses for quality assurance
* Fallback to curated help text for critical operations

---

### Risk 3: Performance on Large Repos

 **Probability** : Low

 **Impact** : Medium

 **Description** : TUI becomes sluggish on repos with 10,000+ commits or 1,000+ files.

 **Mitigation** :

* Pagination for commit timeline (load 100 commits at a time)
* Virtual scrolling for file lists (render only visible items)
* Git operations run asynchronously with loading indicators
* Performance benchmarking on Linux kernel repo (1M+ commits)
* Configurable limits for history depth and file counts

---

### Risk 4: Cross-Platform Terminal Incompatibility

 **Probability** : Medium

 **Impact** : Medium

 **Description** : TUI rendering breaks on certain terminal emulators.

 **Mitigation** :

* Test on top 10 terminal emulators (Terminal.app, iTerm2, Alacritty, Windows Terminal, GNOME Terminal, etc.)
* Use crossterm's compatibility layer
* Fallback to simple line-based UI if TUI initialization fails
* User-selectable color schemes (including monochrome)

---

### Risk 5: GitHub API Rate Limiting

 **Probability** : High

 **Impact** : Low

 **Description** : Heavy users hit GitHub API rate limits (5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users).

 **Mitigation** :

* Cache repository metadata locally (refresh on demand)
* Batch API requests where possible
* Display remaining rate limit in GitHub integration view
* Graceful error handling with retry after rate limit resets
* Educate users about rate limits via AI mentor

---

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

* Merge conflict resolution with AI suggestions

### Phase 4: Learning & Onboarding

* Interactive Git tutorial mode (in-TUI lessons)
* Achievement system for learning milestones
* Playground mode (safe sandbox for experimenting)
* Export history as learning portfolio

### Phase 5: Extensibility

* Plugin system for custom commands
* Theme customization
* Custom AI prompts
* Integration with other tools (Jira, Linear, Slack)

---

## Open Questions

1. **Licensing** : Should zit be open-source (MIT/Apache) or proprietary?

* **Recommendation** : Open-source (MIT) to drive adoption and community contributions

1. **Monetization** : How to sustain AI backend costs?

* **Options** : Freemium (limited AI calls), sponsorware, enterprise licenses
* **Recommendation** : Freemium with 100 AI calls/month free, then $5/month for unlimited

1. **Installation** : Package via Homebrew, Cargo, or standalone binaries?

* **Recommendation** : All three (Homebrew for macOS, Cargo for Rust users, binaries for everyone else)

1. **Telemetry** : Should we collect anonymous usage data to improve the product?

* **Recommendation** : Opt-in telemetry with transparent disclosure and easy opt-out

1. **Windows Support** : Native Windows build or WSL-only?

* **Recommendation** : WSL-only for MVP (simpler), native in Phase 2 if demand exists

---

## Appendix

### Glossary

* **TUI** : Text User Interface (terminal-based graphical interface)
